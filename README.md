# An-Intelligent-IoT-Based-Crop-Protection-System-with-AI-Driven-Animal-Detection-and-Water-Management
Developed an AI-powered agricultural surveillance system using Raspberry Pi 5 and YOLOv8 to detect crop-destroying animals in real-time. The system uses deterrent sounds, monitors environmental conditions, and sends alerts via the Blynk IoT app. It enables remote farm management and supports precision agriculture with scalable, low-cost solutions.
